2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.027 ns between timer_seconds_reg[10]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and data_bcd_reg[10]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.059 ns between timer_seconds_reg[14]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and data_bcd_reg[13]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.106 ns between timer_seconds_reg[14]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and data_bcd_reg[6]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.134 ns between timer_seconds_reg[14]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and data_bcd_reg[12]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on SevenSegmens[0] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on SevenSegmens[1] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.

Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on SevenSegmens[2] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on SevenSegmens[3] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on SevenSegmens[4] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay
